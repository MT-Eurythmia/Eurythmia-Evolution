## Quick project overview

Add a new material called rythium that grow on rythium trees that you can grow with mineral_dirt (with diamond and mithril)
With this material you can craft unique objects like a 3 * 3 pickaxe.

### How to ?

* Melt a diamond in furnace: you get diamond_powder
* Same for a mithril ingot: you get mithril_powder
* Craft 9 mineral dirt (0 = empty; Dp = diamnond_powder; Mp = mithril_powder; Di = default:dirt)

* Make a 3x3 square with it and surround with water
* Plant the rythium sapling in the middle : it will consume the mineral dirt as it grows

* You get a rythium tree with rythium_nuggets
* With 9 rythium nuggets craft a rythium ingot
* And with these rythium ingots you may craft unique items/tools

**Technic mod compatibility** : if technic is used, mithril_dust will be needed instead of mithril_powder
and diamond_powder will be obtained with the grinder.

## Tools
### Healing wand

When used, the healing wand will cure the aimed player, who will get 20 hit points again.

If no player is aimed, the user is cured.

The wand has a limited number of charges (default 20, mays be changed in the mod options)

### Rythium pickaxe (WIP)

This pickaxe wil dig a 3x3 square, like the mining drill of the technic mod.

### Rythium headlamp

This lamp allows a player to see in the dark without using torches. It switches off automatically
when there's enough ambiant light or when the player disconnects.

To switch in on again you need to use the headlamp_controller.
